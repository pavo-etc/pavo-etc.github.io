I went to a party with a very fancy photobooth last week. It would print out a film strip of the images immediately, and the photos were all uploaded to the photographer's website the next day. The only issue with all this is that the photos required a code to download them which the host of the party was never given. The host was content to just screenshot the images but that goes against my religion, so I had to find a better way.

The photographers website presented all the images as a gallery that required an email address to access (coincedentally with a full screen image of me and my friends behind). There was no actual registration or comfirmation involving the email address, so I am not sure why they do this. Once your pass the email form, you are presented with a gallery of all the images from the event, though only 16 load initially, with more appearing as you scroll.
